"Be Boundless."

Haotian Zhang is an incoming Research Scientist at [Apple AI/ML, Visual Intelligence](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research?page=1&domain=Computer+Vision). His research aims to enable embodied agents to understand the outside world. To that end, he works on designing sensible modules that learn the effective representation of information from 2D/3D image data, as well as natural language. His recent work on [GLIP&GLIPv2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-florence-vl/articles/object-detection-in-the-wild-via-grounded-language-image-pre-training/) has been accepted to the CVPR 2022 (Best Paper Finalist), and NeurIPS 2022. He also co-organized the ECCV 2022 workshop on Computer Vision in the Wild.

Prior to joining Apple, he obtained his Ph.D. in the [Information Processing Lab](https://ipl-uw.github.io/) at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/), where he focused on monocular 3D object detection and multi-object tracking. He received his B.S. degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017, supervised by Prof. [Jun-Fa Mao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Junfa).
