**[09/2023]** A summary of my recent papers: (1) a new multimodal LLM that can refer and ground anything anywhere at any granularity [Ferret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07704). (2) using LLM and multimodal LLM for alt-text re-writing to improve CLIP training [veCLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07699).
